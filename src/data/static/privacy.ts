PD is in many ways the same as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). However, PD is broader in scope and covers more data.</p>

    <h4>Collecting Your Location Information</h4>
    <p>When you use our services, we may collect and publish information about your actual physical location to show you products that are offered by other users close to you. We also use geolocation tracking to determine your location when you post your ads so other users can see your location. We may use several technologies like GPS and IP tracking to determine your location. These technologies may also provide us with information about nearby cell towers, Wi-Fi access points, and other devices.</p>

You have the ability to deny or allow our location services and access to your mobile phone camera that collect such information. However, denying our information gathering practices may affect your ability to use our services and post your products for sale.</p>
    <h3>Our Use of Cookies</h3>
    <p>Our mobile app uses cookies. A cookie is a small piece of data or a text file that is downloaded to your computer or mobile device when you access certain websites or mobile apps. Cookies may contain text that can be read by the web server that delivered the cookie to you. The text contained in the cookie generally consists of a sequence of letters and numbers that uniquely identifies your computer or mobile device; it may contain other information as well.</p>
    <p>By agreeing to accept our use of cookies, you are giving us permission to place some or all the cookies described below on your device.</p>
    <h3>Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
    <p>These cookies are necessary for proper functioning of the mobile app, such as displaying content, logging in, validating your session, responding to your request for services, and other functions. Most browsers can be set to disable the use of cookies. However, if you disable these cookies, you may not be able to access features on our mobile app correctly or at all.</p>
    <h3>Performance Cookies</h3>
    <p>These cookies collect information about the use of the mobile app, such as pages visited, traffic sources, user's interests, content management, and other measurements.</p>
    <h3>Functional Cookies</h3>
    <p>These cookies enable the mobile app to remember a user's choices - such as their language, user name, and other personal choices while using the mobile app. They can also be used to deliver services, such as letting a user make a blog post, listen to audio, or watch videos while using the mobile app.</p>
    <h3>Media Cookies</h3>
    <p>These cookies can be used to improve a mobile app's performance and provide special features and content. They can be placed by third parties who provide services to us or by our company.</p>
    <h3>Advertising or Targeting Cookies</h3>
    <p>These cookies are usually placed and used by advertising companies to develop a profile of your browsing interests and serve advertisements to you that are related to your interests. You will see less advertising if you disable these cookies.</p>
    <h3>Session Cookies</h3>
    <p>These cookies allow mobile apps to link the actions of a user during a browser session. They may be used for a variety of purposes, such as remembering what a user has put in their shopping cart as they use a mobile app. Session cookies also permit users to be recognized as they navigate a mobile app so that any item or page changes they make are remembered from page to page. Session cookies expire after a browser session; thus, they are not stored long term.</p>
    <h3>Persistent Cookies</h3>
    <p>These cookies are stored on a user's device in between browser sessions, which allows the user's preferences or actions across a website (or, in some cases, across different websites) to be remembered. Persistent cookies may be used for a variety of purposes, including remembering user's choices and preferences when using a mobile app or to target advertising to them.</p>
    <h3>We may also use cookies for:</h3>

    <h3>Google Analytics Privacy Notice</h3>
    <p>We use Google's Firebase Analytics to collect information about the use of our mobile app. Google Analytics collects information such as how often users use our mobile app, what pages they visit, and what other websites they have visited prior to coming to our mobile app. We use the information we get from Google Analytics to improve our mobile app. Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our mobile app, not your name or other identifying information. We do not combine the information collected using Google Analytics with PD. Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit our site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. You can prevent Google Analytics from using your information by opting out at this link: https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout
    </p>
    <h3>Google Remarketing</h3>
    <p>Why am I seeing ads by Google for products I've viewed? <br>
Our mobile app uses a remarketing advertising service. Our remarketing service is provided by Google and other companies that show our ads on websites and mobile apps. With remarketing you may see ads for our products you have previously looked at. As an example, suppose you visit a website that sells computers, but you do not buy a computer on your first visit to that website. The website's owner might like to encourage you to revisit his/her site and buy a computer by showing you his/her ads again on other websites that you visit. We use remarketing for similar purposes, so you may see advertisements for our products as you search the Internet. For this to happen Google or other remarketing providers will read a cookie that is already in your browser, or they place a cookie in your browser when you visit our site or other sites using remarketing. (This can only happen if your browser is set to let it happen).</p>
    <p>You can opt out of Google's use of cookies and remarketing at this link: https://support.google.com/ads/answer/2662922?hl=en or you opt out using the Network Advertising Initiative opt out page at: http://optout.networkadvertising.org/#!/</p>
    <h3>Remarketing</h3>
    <p>Our mobile app uses Facebook's remarketing advertising service. With remarketing, you may see ads for our products which you have previously looked at when you use Facebook. For this to happen Facebook uses a Custom Audience Pixel that is activated when a visitor lands on a webpage and a unique "cookie" is placed in their browser. To opt out of Facebook remarketing visit: https://www.facebook.com/help/568137493302217</p>

    <p>We retain information that we collect from you (including your PD) only for as long as we need it for legal, business, or tax purposes.

For European customers and users, your PD may be transferred outside the European Union for us to provide the goods, services, and information you request from us to perform a contract with you or to satisfy a legitimate interest of our company in a manner that does not outweigh your freedoms and rights. Wherever we transfer, process or store your PD, we will take reasonable steps to protect it. We will use the information we collect from you in accordance with our privacy notice. By using our mobile app, services, or products, you agree to the transfers of your PD described within this section.</p>
    <p>Also, PD you post on our mobile app for publication may be available worldwide by means of the Internet. We cannot prevent the use or misuse of such information by others.</p>
